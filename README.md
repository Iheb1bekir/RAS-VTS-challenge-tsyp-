# ðŸ§  Predictive Maintenance AI Agent  
### IEEE PES & YP Energy Utopia Challenge â€” Phase 1

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project proposes an **AI-driven Predictive Maintenance Agent** designed to monitor, detect, and predict potential equipment failures in energy systems.  
By leveraging sensor data (temperature, vibration, voltage, etc.), the AI agent can detect early anomalies, estimate the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of devices, and assist technicians in real time through a **dashboard interface**.

The long-term vision is to create a **self-learning maintenance assistant** that improves over time by learning from past incidents, helping to build **smarter, greener, and more reliable energy systems**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Detect** anomalies in real-time sensor data.  
- **Predict** upcoming failures or abnormal system behavior.  
- **Assist** technicians through an interactive dashboard with actionable insights.  
- **Learn** from past maintenance logs to improve future predictions.  
- **Store** all events and data securely in a cloud database for retraining and analysis.

## ðŸ§© Project Scope (Phase 1 â€” Ideation & Data Exploration)

This repository includes:
- A **simulated dataset** representing energy equipment sensor data.  
- Scripts for **data collection**, **cleaning**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- An **initial AI model** for anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and simple forecasting.  
- A prototype **dashboard** (Streamlit-based) to visualize equipment status and detected anomalies.

Future phases will extend this prototype with predictive modeling, cloud integration, and self-learning capabilities.
